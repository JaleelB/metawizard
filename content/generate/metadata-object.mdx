<div className="mt-3" />

## About

Metadata is a crucial part of your Next.js 13 application. It provides essential information about your site, which can be used by search engines, social media platforms, and other services to understand and display your content correctly. Find more information on the Metadata API here: [Next.js Metadata](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).

## Configuration

Updating your metadata in a Next.js 13 project is quite easy. Open your layout.tsx file in your IDE or editor. By default, it should look something like this:

import  CodeBlock  from "../../components/builder/code-block.tsx";

export const layoutCode = `import "./globals.css";
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}`

<div className="w-full mt-6 mb-12">
  <CodeBlock value={layoutCode} />
</div>

import { MetadataCodeRenderer } from "@/components/metadata-code-renderer";

<MetadataCodeRenderer
  functionName="generateMetadataObject"
  text="Now that you've located the layout.tsx file, it's time to update the metadata object. Replace the existing metadata object in your layout.tsx file with the new metadata object provided below:"
/>
