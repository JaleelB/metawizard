## About

The ImageResponse constructor allows you to generate dynamic images using JSX and CSS. This is useful for creating social media images such as Open Graph images, Twitter cards, and more.

ImageResponse uses the Edge Runtime, and Next.js automatically adds the correct headers to cached images at the edge, helping improve performance and reducing recomputation. Find more information on the Metadata API here: [Dynamic Image Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#dynamic-image-generation).

## Configuration

import { MetadataCodeRenderer } from "@/components/metadata-code-renderer";

export const SiteLogo = () => {
  const text = `You can programmatically generate icons using code. Generate an app icon by creating an icon or apple-icon route that default exports a function. The easiest way to generate an icon is to use the ImageResponse API from next/og.
`;
  return <MetadataCodeRenderer functionName="generateSiteLogo" text={text} />;
};

<SiteLogo />

export const OpenGraphTwitterIamge = () => {
  const text = `You can programmatically generate images using code. Generate a route segment's shared image by creating an opengraph-image or twitter-image route that default exports a function. The easiest way to generate an image is to use the ImageResponse API from next/server.`;
  return (
    <MetadataCodeRenderer
      functionName="generateOpenGraphTwitterImage"
      text={text}
    />
  );
};

<OpenGraphTwitterIamge />
